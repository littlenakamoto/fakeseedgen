This tool helps you generate multiple BIP39 seed phrases to confuse potential hackers. If your system is compromised by malware (e.g., keyloggers), the hacker will receive 100 random seed phrasesâ€”99 fake and 1 valid. The goal is to annoy and frustrate attackers by making it much harder for them to identify the real seed phrase.
